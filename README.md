# DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository!

This repo is dedicated to improving my problem-solving skills by practicing a wide range of DSA problems. I will be updating it regularly with solutions written Primarily in Python .

## Goals
- Strengthen core DSA concepts
- Improve coding efficiency and logic building
- Prepare for technical interviews

## Topics to Cover
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Searching and Sorting
- Dynamic Programming

## Platforms I Practice On
- LeetCode
- HackerRank

## Folder Structure (To be updated)


## Progress Tracker
| Topic        | Problems Solved |
|--------------|------------------|
| Arrays       | 1                |
| Strings      | 0                |
| LinkedList   | 0                |
| Trees        | 0                |

I will be updating this table as I solve more problems.
